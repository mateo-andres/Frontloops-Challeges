            <b>T</b>he desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is
            something that rums deep within everyone, even though most people
            dont't take th etome to find someone who truly respect them. it
            seems like people are just looking for someone to show them the
            slightest amount of attention, settlingfor something much less than
            respect. I am convinced one of the best ways to help any
            relationship grow is by showing respect. <br /><br />
            I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.
            What is expected? Respect is showing someone extra special
            attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly
            they are valued.
